# School Management App

This is a mini-project designed to manage school data using Next.js and MySQL. The application features two main pages: one for inputting and storing school data (including image uploads with validation), and another for fetching and displaying the list of registered schools in a responsive, e-commerce-like card layout. The app also includes a responsive navigation bar and an attractive purple-themed user interface.
